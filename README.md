# Tiny RPG Maker

Browser-native RPG maker: paint tiles, build rooms, drop NPCs/enemies/objects, and play instantly in the same page. It’s deliberately small and limited to spark creativity—build micro-stories and tiny RPGs in minutes and share everything as a single URL.

## Run
- Open `index.html` directly in your browser (no server, no build).

## No tooling required
- No frameworks, no libs, no bundlers, no build tools — just vanilla HTML/CSS/JS.

## What it offers
- Side-by-side **Editor/Game** tabs for instant iteration.
- Shareable games: one simple URL = full game.

## Zero install
No downloads or installs. Build a tiny RPG straight in the browser—even on mobile. Try crafting one in a minute and share the link.

## Runs anywhere
Super-light static site: works on old phones, tablets, and desktops. Just open the link in a browser and play.

## Contribute
Fully open source—anyone can help and collaborate on the project.
